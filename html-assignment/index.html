            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is lalili Messaoud ,I am currently studying at <abbr title="Algonquin College">Ac</abbr> 
                I am an ambitious young person with a strong passion for ancient
                architecture and architectural heritage. I am deeply interested 
                in historical buildings and the stories they tell through 
                structure, proportion, and detail. Traditional architecture 
                inspires me because of its balance between strength, beauty,
                and function. For this reason, I decided to study design, 
                as it is closely related to architecture and architectural
                drawing, and it helps me better understand space, form, 
                and visual composition.
            </p>
            <p>
                My future ambition is to create a strong connection between 
                the solidity and authenticity of ancient architecture and 
                the creativity of modern design. I aim to blend traditional 
                architectural principles with contemporary design techniques 
                to produce work that respects the past while embracing innovation.
                 My goal is to develop designs that preserve architectural identity
                  while responding to modern needs, creating a bridge 
                  between historical heritage and modern visual expression,I also believe
                  that learning neverstops <sup>1</sup>,and curiosity is the key to progress

            <blockquote>
                "I don't think that architecture is only about shelter...
                it should be able to excite you, to calm you, to make you think."
